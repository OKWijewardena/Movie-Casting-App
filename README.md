# Movie-Casting-App

The casting process is a crucial step in the production of a movie. The film business is a dynamic and ever-evolving field. It can be time-consuming and ineffective to select actors in Sri Lanka because there is little access to information about available actors and their features. For the Sri Lankan film business, this project suggests creating a web-based system to streamline the casting procedure. While directors can look for actors based on specific criteria and view their profiles, the system will allow actors to create profiles and recommend themselves for roles. The system will also come with an admin interface for controlling the system and keeping an eye on its operation.
